			<li>I have attempted/completed all tasks in the Assignment to completion.</li>
			<li>There are no special features outside of what is required in the Assignment. However, I did want to use more CSS to make the website cleaner but ran out of time so I settled for more basic styles to make the pages look good enough. Some of the things I wanted to be nicer was the footer, and the layout of the forms themselves (even though they are all completely functional).</li>
			<li>I had trouble with the extra task (pagination and mutual friends). However I got it to work just fine</li>
			<li>Next time, I would like to include a new mysql table called "friendRequest". so when a user adds a new friend, rather than going into myfriends, it will go into friendRequest. So when the requested friend logs into their account, it will show a button saying "accept friend request", and then it would move the data from friendRequest into myfriends. This will introduce a functioning request system between accounts, and ALSO will reduce data in myfriends. eg.  (1,2) and (2,1) will not be needed</li>
			<li>There are no additional features to the webstie</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>I did not participate in any of the discussions on the swinburne discussion board, simply because i did not have anything I needed answered by other studetns, nor did I believe I had anything to contribute to the current discussions that already existed on the board.</li>
